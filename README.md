this is a collection of small scripts for parsing some classAdds 
from the condor_status -long.

the sample perl script parses the clasaAdd 

it puts each classAdd into one hash table and all these hash tables are present in one array

this is followed by a search tool which helps in finding out valus of a particular attribute
or vice versa

further if an attribute has a numeric value
the program adds this up and lets the user know the sum of the values of the numeric value 
corresponding to the concerned attribute.

this is part of an exercise
for perl
and is a simple perl program.
